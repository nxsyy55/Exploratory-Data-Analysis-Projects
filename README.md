Projects for Exploratory Data Analysis on Coursera

You can download the data from  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

Notes
==================================
Since I am using a Chinese version R, the x-axis tichks are in Chinese. Basically they are just Friday, Saturday and Sunday in case you wonder what they mean.

Also, I did some preparation on the raw data in Python which makes it faster to read the data into R. This file is called cleanData.csv.

As for the file 'cleanDataToUse.csv', is never used in the scripts since the assignment asks us to show the read-in step in every script.
